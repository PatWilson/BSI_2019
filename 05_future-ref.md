# Future Directions and References

This is just a laundry list of things that I want to build up for Monte Carlo simulations, there is no particular order

1. Testing (how to account for multiple testing?)
2. More example models: Propensity scores, survival analyses
3. Time Series analyses: extend AR 1 model to more complicated structures like seasonality
4. Extend the wedge design to handle more hierarchical structures: Random treatment effect, random time effects
5. Better understanding of confounding control
6. More streamlined process in pulling relevant parameter estimates from the literature
